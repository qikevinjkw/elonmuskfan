To deploy your app to Heroku, you typically use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s master branch to your heroku remote, like so:

git push heroku master

Use this same command whenever you want to deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku.

Note that Heroku only deploys code that you push to the master branch of the heroku remote. Pushing code to another branch of the remote has no effect.
